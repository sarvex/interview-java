/**
 * In a game, you bet using the following strategy. Whenever you lose a bet,
 * you double the value of the bet for the next round. Whenever you win, the bet for the next round
 * will be one dollar. You start the round by betting one dollar.
 * For example, if you start with 20 dollars, and you win the bet in the first round,
 * lose the bet in the next two rounds and then win the bet in the fourth round,
 * you will end up with 20+1-1-2+4 = 22 dollars.
 * <p>
 * You are expected to complete the function, getFinalAmount, which takes two arguments.
 * The first argument is an integer initialAmount which is the initial money we amount we have
 * when we start the betting. The second argument is a string betResultsThe ith character of outcome
 * will be either 'W' (win) or 'L' (lose), denoting the result of the ith round.
 * <p>
 * Your function should return the amount of money you will have after all the rounds are played.
 * If at some point you don't have enough money in your account to cover the value of the bet,
 * you must stop and return the sum you have at that point.
 * <p>
 * Sample Test Cases:
 * <p>
 * Input #00:
 * 12
 * WWWWWWWW
 * <p>
 * Output #00:
 * 20
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * The initial amount is 12, for every win, you gain 1 dollar.
 * There are totally 8 consecutive wins and no losses, hence total money gained = 12 + 8 = 20
 * <p>
 * Input #01:
 * 15
 * LLLWLLLL
 * <p>
 * Output #01:
 * 1
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * The initial amount is 15. As stated in the problem, the amount of bet doubles for every loss.
 * 1st round - Loss: 15-1 = 14
 * 2nd round - Loss: 14-2 = 12 (Bet doubles)
 * 3rd round - Loss: 12-4 = 8
 * 4th round - Win: 8 + 8 = 16
 * 5th round - Loss:16-1 = 15 (Since the previous bet was a win, this bet has a value of 1 dollar)
 * 6th round - Loss: 15-2 = 13
 * 7th round - Loss: 13-4 = 9
 * 8th round - Loss: 9-8 = 1
