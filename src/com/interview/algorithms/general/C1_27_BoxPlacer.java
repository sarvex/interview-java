/**
 * There are k exactly same boxes, and we have to put n exactly same items into them.
 * Assume there is no limitation on box, and the only requirement is that each item should
 * be put into one box. Please write out the code to print out all the possible possibilities,
 * print error the input can not get any result.
 * Input:
 * The number of items: n, and the number of boxes: k
 * Output:
 * All the possibilities of putting items into boxes, print error if the input is not correct.
 * Sample Input
 * 5 2  (the first number for n, the second number for k)
 * Sample Output
 * 0   5  (all 5 items are put into one box, and the left box is empty)
 * 1   4  (one item is put into one box, and 4 items are put into another one)
 * 2   3  (two items are put into one box, and 3 items are put into another one)
